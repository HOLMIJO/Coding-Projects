<h2>Great Food Comes First</h2>
<br>
<p>Here is a quote from Burger King's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="bk.com/about-bk.html">
Every day, more than 11 million guests visit Burger King restaurants around the world. And they do so because our restaurants are known for serving high-quality, great-tasting, and affordable food. Founded in 1954, Burger King is the second largest fast food hamburger chain in the world. The original Home of the Whopper, our commitment to premium ingredients, signature recipes, and family-friendly dining experiences is what has defined our brand for more than 50 successful years.
