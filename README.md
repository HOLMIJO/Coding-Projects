HTML and CSS Projects for The Tech Academy

This is a display of sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS.

<ul><b>Projects</b>
  <li>Space Station Site</li>
  <li>Movie Theater Site</li>
  </ul>
  
  <b>Space Station Site</b>
  This page is an example home page for a Space travel company. It's styled using CSS and contains
  a navbar, image containers, and a form.
  
  <b>Movie Theatre Site</b>
  This page is an example home page for a Movie theater that is styled using Bootstrap 4.
  It contains many Bootstrap components including but not limited to a navbar, jumbotron, form,
  cards, and dropdowns.
